# Credit Card Fraud Detection

An ensemble method based on majority voting(Hard Voting Classifier) of deep learning models to detect fraud transaction. Artificial neural network(ANN), convolution neural network(CNN), recurrent neural network(RNN), long short term memory(LSTM) and gated recurrent units(GRU) has been used as deep learning models.
